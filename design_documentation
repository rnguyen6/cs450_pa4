Design was to fill directly accessed blocks with pointers to data blocks (pointer, length). This removes the need for indirect block pointers.
It would create sufficiently large files sizes, but causes internal fragmentation if small extent files are made. It made for simpler code.

Changes are as follows:
  For extent:
    fnctl.h   - defines o type
    stat.h    - defines t type
    sysfile.c - sys_open: conditions with extent
    fs.c      - bmap: core implemntation
              - itrunc: frees the bmap allocations
  For fstat:
    ls.c      - extent case, making sure extent file first before moving on
    test.c    - executing test cases
    stat.h    - addrs to access from stats
 For lseek:
    syscall.h	- syscall number
    usys.S		- new syscall
    user.h		- syscall def
    syscall.c	- adding to list
