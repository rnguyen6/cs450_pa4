Design was to fill directly accessed blocks with pointers to data blocks (pointer, length). This removes the need for indirect block pointers.
It would create sufficiently large files sizes, but causes internal fragmentation if small extent files are made (which should use traditional file creations). It made for simpler code.

Changes are as follows (see file_modifications for specific code and process):
  For extent:
    fnctl.h   - defines o type
    stat.h    - defines t type
    sysfile.c - sys_open: conditions with extent
    fs.c      - bmap: core implemntation
              - stati: copies addrs for printing
  For fstat:
    ls.c      - extent case, making sure extent file first before moving on
    test.c    - executing test cases
    stat.h    - addrs to access from stats
 For lseek:
    syscall.h	- syscall number
    usys.S		- new syscall
    user.h		- syscall def
    syscall.c	- adding to list
